Developed an innovative app that allows doctors to monitor patients’ vital signs remotely in real-time. The app utilizes artificial intelligence to provide accurate predictions of health status and automatically updates the patient’s “Smart Medical Profile” with new data.
ARVA – AI Remote Vital Assistant, a smart healthcare system designed to:
	1-	Monitor vital signs in real time (ICU)
	2-	Predict health conditions and vital signs using AI
	3-	Analyze medical reports automatically
	4-	Provide personalized preventive health recommendations
	5-	Predict medication dosages and schedules
	6-	Send instant alerts for critical cases
	7-	Connect patients and medical staff in one smart platform

All powered by advanced AI models such as GRU & MLP (multi-classification).
